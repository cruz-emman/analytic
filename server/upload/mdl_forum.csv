opportunities. I came to understand that God may have directed
me towards this exceptional path with a purpose to prepare, train and mold student pharmacists
as an authentic source of drug-related information and vital part of the healthcare community.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In my years of studying and early years of practice, I desired for more patient-oriented pharmacy practice. I worked directly with physicians and other healthcare professionals to ensure that the medications prescribed for patients contribute to the best possible health outcomes. As a Clinical Pharmacist, it is my responsibility to evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient's medications. Indeed, it was a rewarding experience to be able to provide drug therapy counseling to patients. Fast forward to today, seeing how our TUA students raise the practice of pharmacy makes my career road a more meaningful, fulfilling and rewarding one. As a young pharmacist and educator, I am equipped with vast amount of energy and time hence, I am utilizing these to become an instrument in calibrating students' potentials and take part in the evolution of Pharmacy Practice to be fully recognized as an extraordinary profession in our country.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">In behalf of the Faculty of Pharmacy Department, College of Allied Health Sciences, I welcome you to Trinity University of Asia!&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><strong>100% Board Passing Rate!&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">By enrolling in this program, you will learn how to&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">develop&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">and&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">manufacture drugs</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">&nbsp;for the&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">diagnosis</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">,&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">treatment&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">and&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">prevention of diseases</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">; how to&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">manage pharmacies</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">&nbsp;and how to&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">assist patients</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">&nbsp;with&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">health and drug-related concerns</span><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><span>.

Students are also taught how to perform associated clerical duties, including scheduling and maintaining paperwork for office and clinical settings.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are required to attend an On the Job Training (OJT) in different tertiary hospitals doing clinical duty. Students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in an actual work setting. To become a licensed radiologic technologist, a graduate of BS in Radiologic Technology needs to pass the Radiologic Technology Licensure Examination. The examination is conducted by the Board of Radiologic Technology under the supervision of the Professional Regulations Commission (PRC).

it. Getting the most out of your investment will only happen if the value that you get from it (revenue) is greater than the cost of getting it.<br><br>Dr. Marlon J. Gomez<br>Dean of Students",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1596537931,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2495,530,general,Importance of History,"<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""></p><p dir=""ltr"">History is important to study because it is essential for all of us in understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a history of every field and topic, from medicine, to music, to art. To know and understand history is absolutely necessary, even though the results of historical study are not as visible, and less immediate.<br></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Allows You To Comprehend More</h2><h3>1. Our World</h3><p>History gives us a very clear picture of how the various aspects of society — such as technology, governmental systems, and even society as a whole — worked in the past so we understand how it came to work the way it is now.</p><p>&nbsp;2. Society And Other People</p><p>Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Identity</p><p>&nbsp;History can help provide us with a sense of identity. This is actually one of the main reasons that history is still taught in schools around the world. Historians have been able to learn about how countries, families, and groups were formed, and how they evolved and developed over time. When an individual takes it upon themselves to dive deep into their own family’s history, they can understand how their family interacted with larger historical change. Did family serve in major wars? Were they present for significant events?</p><p>&nbsp;4. Present-Day Issues</p><p>History helps us to understand present-day issues by asking deeper questions as to why things are the way they are. Why did wars in Europe in the 20th century matter to countries around the world? How did Hitler gain and maintain power for as long as he had? How has this had an effect on shaping our world and our global political system today?</p><p>&nbsp;5. The Process Of Change Over Time</p><p>&nbsp;If we want to truly understand why something happened — in any area or field, such as one political party winning the last election vs the other, or a major change in the number of smokers — you need to look for factors that took place earlier. Only through the study of history can people really see and grasp the reasons behind these changes, and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society continue regardless of continual change.</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/yusuf-dundar-Dox_cgBLyfA-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505630683.jpg"" alt=""Wander through ancient ruins""><br></p><h2>You Learn A Clear Lesson<br></h2><h3>1. Political Intelligence</h3><p>&nbsp;History can help us become better informed citizens. It shows us who we are as a collective group, and being informed of this is a key element in maintaining a democratic society. This knowledge helps people take an active role in the political forum through educated debates and by refining people’s core beliefs. Through knowledge of history, citizens can even change their old belief systems.</p><p>&nbsp;2. History Teaches Morals And Values</p><p>&nbsp;By looking at specific stories of individuals and situations, you can test your own morals and values. You can compare it to some real and difficult situations individuals have had to face in trying times. Looking to people who have faced and overcome adversity can be inspiring. You can study the great people of history who successfully worked through moral dilemmas, and also ordinary people who teach us lessons in courage, persistence and protest.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Builds Better Citizenship</p><p>&nbsp;The study of history is a non-negotiable aspect of better citizenship. This is one of the main reasons why it is taught as a part of school curricula. People that push for citizenship history (relationship between a citizen and the state) just want to promote a strong national identity and even national loyalty through the teaching of lessons of individual and collective success.</p><p>&nbsp;4. Learn From The Past And Notice Clear Warning Signs</p><p>&nbsp;We learn from past atrocities against groups of people; genocides, wars, and attacks. Through this collective suffering, we have learned to pay attention to the warning signs leading up to such atrocities. Society has been able to take these warning signs and fight against them when they see them in the present day. Knowing what events led up to these various wars helps us better influence our future.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Gaining A Career Through History</p><p>&nbsp;The skills that are acquired through learning about history, such as critical thinking, research, assessing information, etc., are all useful skills that are sought by employers. Many employers see these skills as being an asset in their employees and will hire those with history degrees in various roles and industries.</p><h3>6. Personal Growth And Appreciation</h3><p>&nbsp;Understanding past events and how they impact the world today can bring about empathy and understanding for groups of people whose history may be different from the mainstream. You will also understand the suffering, joy, and chaos that were necessary for the present day to happen and appreciate all that you are able to benefit from past efforts today.</p><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/giammarco-boscaro-zeH-ljawHtg-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505658645.jpg"" alt=""Take a walk through any library to find countless books about history""><br><p></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Develop And Refine Your Skills Through Studying History</h2><h3>1. Reading And Writing</h3><p>&nbsp;You can refine your reading skills by reading texts from a wide array of time periods. Language has changed and evolved over time and so has the way people write and express themselves. You can also refine your writing skills through learning to not just repeat what someone else said, but to analyze information from multiple sources and come up with your own conclusions. It’s two birds with one stone — better writing and critical thinking!</p><p>&nbsp;2. Craft Your Own Opinions</p><p>&nbsp;There are so many sources of information out in the world. Finding a decisive truth for many topics just doesn’t exist. What was a victory for one group was a great loss for another — you get to create your own opinions of these events.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Decision-Making</p><p>&nbsp;History gives us the opportunity to learn from others’ past mistakes. It helps us understand the many reasons why people may behave the way they do. As a result, it helps us become more impartial as decision-makers.</p><p>&nbsp;4. How To Do Research</p><p>&nbsp;In the study of history you will need to conduct research. This gives you the opportunity to look at two kinds of sources — primary (written at the time) and secondary sources (written about a time period, after the fact). This practice can teach you how to decipher between reliable and unreliable sources.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Quantitative Analysis</p><p>&nbsp;There are numbers and data to be learned from history. In terms of patterns: patterns in population, desertions during times of war, and even in environmental factors. These patterns that are found help clarify why things happened as they did.</p><p>&nbsp;6. Qualitative Analysis</p><p>It’s incredibly important to learn to question the quality of the information and “history” you are learning. Keep these two questions in mind as you read through information: How do I know what I’m reading are facts and accurate information? Could they be the writer’s opinions?</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/matteo-maretto-9KkPloRgOUY-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593506113470.jpg"" alt=""Museum with sculptures""><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">What do you think are the other importance of history that was not mention in this discussion?

Here are two examples of using the geographic perspective to understand history:&nbsp;<br><p></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. The Philippines has been colonized by three countries (Spain, US, and Japan) over the years. If you will look at the location of the Philippines on the map, it is obvious that it is surrounded by water. This geographical location of the Philippines is one reason why it was very easy for invaders to enter our territory with ease. Although it was never the plan of Ferdinand Magellan to discover the Philippines in his journey, the chance of discovering our land apparently became easier and more probable due to the Philippines' archipelagic features.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">2. You may wonder why the Philippines is not a state of the US. Our geographical-proximal location is the reason why the US did not consider us a possible state. The Philippines is way too far from mainland US and travelling by boat or ship will take days during that time. Hawaii offered a different scenario to the US since proximity wise it is closer than the mainland and its location in the center of the Pacific serves as a perfect gateway to the US.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Forum:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Can you think of other relationship that exists between history and geography in the Philippine context?

Only through the study of history can people really see and grasp the reasons behind these changes, and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society continue regardless of continual change.</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/yusuf-dundar-Dox_cgBLyfA-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505630683.jpg"" alt=""Wander through ancient ruins""><br></p><h2>You Learn A Clear Lesson<br></h2><h3>1. Political Intelligence</h3><p>&nbsp;History can help us become better informed citizens. It shows us who we are as a collective group, and being informed of this is a key element in maintaining a democratic society. This knowledge helps people take an active role in the political forum through educated debates and by refining people’s core beliefs. Through knowledge of history, citizens can even change their old belief systems.</p><p>&nbsp;2. History Teaches Morals And Values</p><p>&nbsp;By looking at specific stories of individuals and situations, you can test your own morals and values. You can compare it to some real and difficult situations individuals have had to face in trying times. Looking to people who have faced and overcome adversity can be inspiring. You can study the great people of history who successfully worked through moral dilemmas, and also ordinary people who teach us lessons in courage, persistence and protest.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Builds Better Citizenship</p><p>&nbsp;The study of history is a non-negotiable aspect of better citizenship. This is one of the main reasons why it is taught as a part of school curricula. People that push for citizenship history (relationship between a citizen and the state) just want to promote a strong national identity and even national loyalty through the teaching of lessons of individual and collective success.</p><p>&nbsp;4. Learn From The Past And Notice Clear Warning Signs</p><p>&nbsp;We learn from past atrocities against groups of people; genocides, wars, and attacks. Through this collective suffering, we have learned to pay attention to the warning signs leading up to such atrocities. Society has been able to take these warning signs and fight against them when they see them in the present day. Knowing what events led up to these various wars helps us better influence our future.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Gaining A Career Through History</p><p>&nbsp;The skills that are acquired through learning about history, such as critical thinking, research, assessing information, etc., are all useful skills that are sought by employers. Many employers see these skills as being an asset in their employees and will hire those with history degrees in various roles and industries.</p><h3>6. Personal Growth And Appreciation</h3><p>&nbsp;Understanding past events and how they impact the world today can bring about empathy and understanding for groups of people whose history may be different from the mainstream. You will also understand the suffering, joy, and chaos that were necessary for the present day to happen and appreciate all that you are able to benefit from past efforts today.</p><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/giammarco-boscaro-zeH-ljawHtg-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505658645.jpg"" alt=""Take a walk through any library to find countless books about history""><br><p></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Develop And Refine Your Skills Through Studying History</h2><h3>1. Reading And Writing</h3><p>&nbsp;You can refine your reading skills by reading texts from a wide array of time periods. Language has changed and evolved over time and so has the way people write and express themselves. You can also refine your writing skills through learning to not just repeat what someone else said, but to analyze information from multiple sources and come up with your own conclusions. It’s two birds with one stone — better writing and critical thinking!</p><p>&nbsp;2. Craft Your Own Opinions</p><p>&nbsp;There are so many sources of information out in the world. Finding a decisive truth for many topics just doesn’t exist. What was a victory for one group was a great loss for another — you get to create your own opinions of these events.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Decision-Making</p><p>&nbsp;History gives us the opportunity to learn from others’ past mistakes. It helps us understand the many reasons why people may behave the way they do. As a result, it helps us become more impartial as decision-makers.</p><p>&nbsp;4. How To Do Research</p><p>&nbsp;In the study of history you will need to conduct research. This gives you the opportunity to look at two kinds of sources — primary (written at the time) and secondary sources (written about a time period, after the fact). This practice can teach you how to decipher between reliable and unreliable sources.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Quantitative Analysis</p><p>&nbsp;There are numbers and data to be learned from history. In terms of patterns: patterns in population, desertions during times of war, and even in environmental factors. These patterns that are found help clarify why things happened as they did.</p><p>&nbsp;6. Qualitative Analysis</p><p>It’s incredibly important to learn to question the quality of the information and “history” you are learning. Keep these two questions in mind as you read through information: How do I know what I’m reading are facts and accurate information? Could they be the writer’s opinions?</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/matteo-maretto-9KkPloRgOUY-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593506113470.jpg"" alt=""Museum with sculptures""><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">What do you think are the other importance of history that was not mention in this discussion?

History views human experience from the perspective of time, geography from the perspective of space. These dimensions of time and space are locked in an interactive feedback loop in which one dimension constantly affects the other.<br></p><p dir=""ltr"">According to Broek (1941), there are three assumptions to be considered in establishing the link between Geography and History:&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""></p><ul><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding geography.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding the past.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the past without understanding geography.</li></ul>In other words, the rationale for history (studying the past to understand the present) requires knowing geography: today's geography and the geography of different places at different times in the past. Here are two examples of using the geographic perspective to understand history:&nbsp;<br><p></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. The Philippines has been colonized by three countries (Spain, US, and Japan) over the years. If you will look at the location of the Philippines on the map, it is obvious that it is surrounded by water. This geographical location of the Philippines is one reason why it was very easy for invaders to enter our territory with ease. Although it was never the plan of Ferdinand Magellan to discover the Philippines in his journey, the chance of discovering our land apparently became easier and more probable due to the Philippines' archipelagic features.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">2. You may wonder why the Philippines is not a state of the US. Our geographical-proximal location is the reason why the US did not consider us a possible state. The Philippines is way too far from mainland US and travelling by boat or ship will take days during that time. Hawaii offered a different scenario to the US since proximity wise it is closer than the mainland and its location in the center of the Pacific serves as a perfect gateway to the US.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Forum:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Can you think of other relationship that exists between history and geography in the Philippine context?

2535,542,general,Importance of History,"<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""></p><p dir=""ltr"">History is important to study because it is essential for all of us in understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a history of every field and topic, from medicine, to music, to art. To know and understand history is absolutely necessary, even though the results of historical study are not as visible, and less immediate.<br></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Allows You To Comprehend More</h2><h3>1. Our World</h3><p>History gives us a very clear picture of how the various aspects of society — such as technology, governmental systems, and even society as a whole — worked in the past so we understand how it came to work the way it is now.</p><p>&nbsp;2. Society And Other People</p><p>Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Identity</p><p>&nbsp;History can help provide us with a sense of identity. This is actually one of the main reasons that history is still taught in schools around the world. Historians have been able to learn about how countries, families, and groups were formed, and how they evolved and developed over time. When an individual takes it upon themselves to dive deep into their own family’s history, they can understand how their family interacted with larger historical change. Did family serve in major wars? Were they present for significant events?</p><p>&nbsp;4. Present-Day Issues</p><p>History helps us to understand present-day issues by asking deeper questions as to why things are the way they are. Why did wars in Europe in the 20th century matter to countries around the world? How did Hitler gain and maintain power for as long as he had?

It shows us who we are as a collective group, and being informed of this is a key element in maintaining a democratic society. This knowledge helps people take an active role in the political forum through educated debates and by refining people’s core beliefs. Through knowledge of history, citizens can even change their old belief systems.</p><p>&nbsp;2. History Teaches Morals And Values</p><p>&nbsp;By looking at specific stories of individuals and situations, you can test your own morals and values. You can compare it to some real and difficult situations individuals have had to face in trying times. Looking to people who have faced and overcome adversity can be inspiring. You can study the great people of history who successfully worked through moral dilemmas, and also ordinary people who teach us lessons in courage, persistence and protest.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Builds Better Citizenship</p><p>&nbsp;The study of history is a non-negotiable aspect of better citizenship. This is one of the main reasons why it is taught as a part of school curricula. People that push for citizenship history (relationship between a citizen and the state) just want to promote a strong national identity and even national loyalty through the teaching of lessons of individual and collective success.</p><p>&nbsp;4. Learn From The Past And Notice Clear Warning Signs</p><p>&nbsp;We learn from past atrocities against groups of people; genocides, wars, and attacks. Through this collective suffering, we have learned to pay attention to the warning signs leading up to such atrocities. Society has been able to take these warning signs and fight against them when they see them in the present day. Knowing what events led up to these various wars helps us better influence our future.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Gaining A Career Through History</p><p>&nbsp;The skills that are acquired through learning about history, such as critical thinking, research, assessing information, etc., are all useful skills that are sought by employers. Many employers see these skills as being an asset in their employees and will hire those with history degrees in various roles and industries.</p><h3>6. Personal Growth And Appreciation</h3><p>&nbsp;Understanding past events and how they impact the world today can bring about empathy and understanding for groups of people whose history may be different from the mainstream. You will also understand the suffering, joy, and chaos that were necessary for the present day to happen and appreciate all that you are able to benefit from past efforts today.</p><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/giammarco-boscaro-zeH-ljawHtg-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505658645.jpg"" alt=""Take a walk through any library to find countless books about history""><br><p></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Develop And Refine Your Skills Through Studying History</h2><h3>1. Reading And Writing</h3><p>&nbsp;You can refine your reading skills by reading texts from a wide array of time periods. Language has changed and evolved over time and so has the way people write and express themselves. You can also refine your writing skills through learning to not just repeat what someone else said, but to analyze information from multiple sources and come up with your own conclusions. It’s two birds with one stone — better writing and critical thinking!</p><p>&nbsp;2. Craft Your Own Opinions</p><p>&nbsp;There are so many sources of information out in the world. Finding a decisive truth for many topics just doesn’t exist. What was a victory for one group was a great loss for another — you get to create your own opinions of these events.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Decision-Making</p><p>&nbsp;History gives us the opportunity to learn from others’ past mistakes. It helps us understand the many reasons why people may behave the way they do. As a result, it helps us become more impartial as decision-makers.</p><p>&nbsp;4. How To Do Research</p><p>&nbsp;In the study of history you will need to conduct research. This gives you the opportunity to look at two kinds of sources — primary (written at the time) and secondary sources (written about a time period, after the fact). This practice can teach you how to decipher between reliable and unreliable sources.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Quantitative Analysis</p><p>&nbsp;There are numbers and data to be learned from history. In terms of patterns: patterns in population, desertions during times of war, and even in environmental factors. These patterns that are found help clarify why things happened as they did.</p><p>&nbsp;6. Qualitative Analysis</p><p>It’s incredibly important to learn to question the quality of the information and “history” you are learning. Keep these two questions in mind as you read through information: How do I know what I’m reading are facts and accurate information? Could they be the writer’s opinions?</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/matteo-maretto-9KkPloRgOUY-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593506113470.jpg"" alt=""Museum with sculptures""><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">What do you think are the other importance of history that was not mention in this discussion?

History views human experience from the perspective of time, geography from the perspective of space. These dimensions of time and space are locked in an interactive feedback loop in which one dimension constantly affects the other.<br></p><p dir=""ltr"">According to Broek (1941), there are three assumptions to be considered in establishing the link between Geography and History:&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""></p><ul><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding geography.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding the past.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the past without understanding geography.</li></ul>In other words, the rationale for history (studying the past to understand the present) requires knowing geography: today's geography and the geography of different places at different times in the past. Here are two examples of using the geographic perspective to understand history:&nbsp;<br><p></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. The Philippines has been colonized by three countries (Spain, US, and Japan) over the years. If you will look at the location of the Philippines on the map, it is obvious that it is surrounded by water. This geographical location of the Philippines is one reason why it was very easy for invaders to enter our territory with ease. Although it was never the plan of Ferdinand Magellan to discover the Philippines in his journey, the chance of discovering our land apparently became easier and more probable due to the Philippines' archipelagic features.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">2. You may wonder why the Philippines is not a state of the US. Our geographical-proximal location is the reason why the US did not consider us a possible state. The Philippines is way too far from mainland US and travelling by boat or ship will take days during that time. Hawaii offered a different scenario to the US since proximity wise it is closer than the mainland and its location in the center of the Pacific serves as a perfect gateway to the US.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Forum:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Can you think of other relationship that exists between history and geography in the Philippine context?

2557,551,general,Importance of History,"<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""></p><p dir=""ltr"">History is important to study because it is essential for all of us in understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a history of every field and topic, from medicine, to music, to art. To know and understand history is absolutely necessary, even though the results of historical study are not as visible, and less immediate.<br></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Allows You To Comprehend More</h2><h3>1. Our World</h3><p>History gives us a very clear picture of how the various aspects of society — such as technology, governmental systems, and even society as a whole — worked in the past so we understand how it came to work the way it is now.</p><p>&nbsp;2. Society And Other People</p><p>Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Identity</p><p>&nbsp;History can help provide us with a sense of identity. This is actually one of the main reasons that history is still taught in schools around the world. Historians have been able to learn about how countries, families, and groups were formed, and how they evolved and developed over time. When an individual takes it upon themselves to dive deep into their own family’s history, they can understand how their family interacted with larger historical change. Did family serve in major wars? Were they present for significant events?</p><p>&nbsp;4. Present-Day Issues</p><p>History helps us to understand present-day issues by asking deeper questions as to why things are the way they are. Why did wars in Europe in the 20th century matter to countries around the world? How did Hitler gain and maintain power for as long as he had? How has this had an effect on shaping our world and our global political system today?</p><p>&nbsp;5. The Process Of Change Over Time</p><p>&nbsp;If we want to truly understand why something happened — in any area or field, such as one political party winning the last election vs the other, or a major change in the number of smokers — you need to look for factors that took place earlier. Only through the study of history can people really see and grasp the reasons behind these changes, and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society continue regardless of continual change.</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/yusuf-dundar-Dox_cgBLyfA-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505630683.jpg"" alt=""Wander through ancient ruins""><br></p><h2>You Learn A Clear Lesson<br></h2><h3>1.

History views human experience from the perspective of time, geography from the perspective of space. These dimensions of time and space are locked in an interactive feedback loop in which one dimension constantly affects the other.<br></p><p dir=""ltr"">According to Broek (1941), there are three assumptions to be considered in establishing the link between Geography and History:&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""></p><ul><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding geography.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding the past.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the past without understanding geography.</li></ul>In other words, the rationale for history (studying the past to understand the present) requires knowing geography: today's geography and the geography of different places at different times in the past. Here are two examples of using the geographic perspective to understand history:&nbsp;<br><p></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. The Philippines has been colonized by three countries (Spain, US, and Japan) over the years. If you will look at the location of the Philippines on the map, it is obvious that it is surrounded by water. This geographical location of the Philippines is one reason why it was very easy for invaders to enter our territory with ease. Although it was never the plan of Ferdinand Magellan to discover the Philippines in his journey, the chance of discovering our land apparently became easier and more probable due to the Philippines' archipelagic features.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">2. You may wonder why the Philippines is not a state of the US. Our geographical-proximal location is the reason why the US did not consider us a possible state. The Philippines is way too far from mainland US and travelling by boat or ship will take days during that time. Hawaii offered a different scenario to the US since proximity wise it is closer than the mainland and its location in the center of the Pacific serves as a perfect gateway to the US.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Forum:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Can you think of other relationship that exists between history and geography in the Philippine context? Provide events in the past to show the relationship between the two. Everybody is tasked to participate in the forum. You are encouraged to engage academic discussions with your peers to make this forum as interactive as possible.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Reference/s:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Jan O.

2770,1388,general,Importance of History,"<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""></p><p dir=""ltr"">History is important to study because it is essential for all of us in understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is a history of every field and topic, from medicine, to music, to art. To know and understand history is absolutely necessary, even though the results of historical study are not as visible, and less immediate.<br></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Allows You To Comprehend More</h2><h3>1. Our World</h3><p>History gives us a very clear picture of how the various aspects of society — such as technology, governmental systems, and even society as a whole — worked in the past so we understand how it came to work the way it is now.</p><p>&nbsp;2. Society And Other People</p><p>Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Identity</p><p>&nbsp;History can help provide us with a sense of identity. This is actually one of the main reasons that history is still taught in schools around the world. Historians have been able to learn about how countries, families, and groups were formed, and how they evolved and developed over time. When an individual takes it upon themselves to dive deep into their own family’s history, they can understand how their family interacted with larger historical change. Did family serve in major wars? Were they present for significant events?</p><p>&nbsp;4. Present-Day Issues</p><p>History helps us to understand present-day issues by asking deeper questions as to why things are the way they are. Why did wars in Europe in the 20th century matter to countries around the world? How did Hitler gain and maintain power for as long as he had? How has this had an effect on shaping our world and our global political system today?</p><p>&nbsp;5. The Process Of Change Over Time</p><p>&nbsp;If we want to truly understand why something happened — in any area or field, such as one political party winning the last election vs the other, or a major change in the number of smokers — you need to look for factors that took place earlier. Only through the study of history can people really see and grasp the reasons behind these changes, and only through history can we understand what elements of an institution or a society continue regardless of continual change.</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/yusuf-dundar-Dox_cgBLyfA-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505630683.jpg"" alt=""Wander through ancient ruins""><br></p><h2>You Learn A Clear Lesson<br></h2><h3>1. Political Intelligence</h3><p>&nbsp;History can help us become better informed citizens. It shows us who we are as a collective group, and being informed of this is a key element in maintaining a democratic society. This knowledge helps people take an active role in the political forum through educated debates and by refining people’s core beliefs. Through knowledge of history, citizens can even change their old belief systems.</p><p>&nbsp;2. History Teaches Morals And Values</p><p>&nbsp;By looking at specific stories of individuals and situations, you can test your own morals and values. You can compare it to some real and difficult situations individuals have had to face in trying times. Looking to people who have faced and overcome adversity can be inspiring. You can study the great people of history who successfully worked through moral dilemmas, and also ordinary people who teach us lessons in courage, persistence and protest.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Builds Better Citizenship</p><p>&nbsp;The study of history is a non-negotiable aspect of better citizenship. This is one of the main reasons why it is taught as a part of school curricula. People that push for citizenship history (relationship between a citizen and the state) just want to promote a strong national identity and even national loyalty through the teaching of lessons of individual and collective success.</p><p>&nbsp;4. Learn From The Past And Notice Clear Warning Signs</p><p>&nbsp;We learn from past atrocities against groups of people; genocides, wars, and attacks. Through this collective suffering, we have learned to pay attention to the warning signs leading up to such atrocities. Society has been able to take these warning signs and fight against them when they see them in the present day. Knowing what events led up to these various wars helps us better influence our future.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Gaining A Career Through History</p><p>&nbsp;The skills that are acquired through learning about history, such as critical thinking, research, assessing information, etc., are all useful skills that are sought by employers. Many employers see these skills as being an asset in their employees and will hire those with history degrees in various roles and industries.</p><h3>6. Personal Growth And Appreciation</h3><p>&nbsp;Understanding past events and how they impact the world today can bring about empathy and understanding for groups of people whose history may be different from the mainstream. You will also understand the suffering, joy, and chaos that were necessary for the present day to happen and appreciate all that you are able to benefit from past efforts today.</p><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/giammarco-boscaro-zeH-ljawHtg-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593505658645.jpg"" alt=""Take a walk through any library to find countless books about history""><br><p></p><p dir=""ltr""></p><h2>Develop And Refine Your Skills Through Studying History</h2><h3>1. Reading And Writing</h3><p>&nbsp;You can refine your reading skills by reading texts from a wide array of time periods. Language has changed and evolved over time and so has the way people write and express themselves. You can also refine your writing skills through learning to not just repeat what someone else said, but to analyze information from multiple sources and come up with your own conclusions. It’s two birds with one stone — better writing and critical thinking!</p><p>&nbsp;2. Craft Your Own Opinions</p><p>&nbsp;There are so many sources of information out in the world. Finding a decisive truth for many topics just doesn’t exist. What was a victory for one group was a great loss for another — you get to create your own opinions of these events.</p><p>&nbsp;3. Decision-Making</p><p>&nbsp;History gives us the opportunity to learn from others’ past mistakes. It helps us understand the many reasons why people may behave the way they do. As a result, it helps us become more impartial as decision-makers.</p><p>&nbsp;4. How To Do Research</p><p>&nbsp;In the study of history you will need to conduct research. This gives you the opportunity to look at two kinds of sources — primary (written at the time) and secondary sources (written about a time period, after the fact). This practice can teach you how to decipher between reliable and unreliable sources.</p><p>&nbsp;5. Quantitative Analysis</p><p>&nbsp;There are numbers and data to be learned from history. In terms of patterns: patterns in population, desertions during times of war, and even in environmental factors. These patterns that are found help clarify why things happened as they did.</p><p>&nbsp;6. Qualitative Analysis</p><p>It’s incredibly important to learn to question the quality of the information and “history” you are learning. Keep these two questions in mind as you read through information: How do I know what I’m reading are facts and accurate information? Could they be the writer’s opinions?</p><p dir=""ltr""><img src=""https://www.uopeople.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/matteo-maretto-9KkPloRgOUY-unsplash-1-scaled-e1593506113470.jpg"" alt=""Museum with sculptures""><br></p><p dir=""ltr"">What do you think are the other importance of history that was not mention in this discussion?

History views human experience from the perspective of time, geography from the perspective of space. These dimensions of time and space are locked in an interactive feedback loop in which one dimension constantly affects the other.<br></p><p dir=""ltr"">According to Broek (1941), there are three assumptions to be considered in establishing the link between Geography and History:&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""></p><ul><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding geography.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the present without understanding the past.</li><li>It is impossible to understand the past without understanding geography.</li></ul>In other words, the rationale for history (studying the past to understand the present) requires knowing geography: today's geography and the geography of different places at different times in the past. Here are two examples of using the geographic perspective to understand history:&nbsp;<br><p></p><p dir=""ltr"">1. The Philippines has been colonized by three countries (Spain, US, and Japan) over the years. If you will look at the location of the Philippines on the map, it is obvious that it is surrounded by water. This geographical location of the Philippines is one reason why it was very easy for invaders to enter our territory with ease. Although it was never the plan of Ferdinand Magellan to discover the Philippines in his journey, the chance of discovering our land apparently became easier and more probable due to the Philippines' archipelagic features.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr"">2. You may wonder why the Philippines is not a state of the US. Our geographical-proximal location is the reason why the US did not consider us a possible state. The Philippines is way too far from mainland US and travelling by boat or ship will take days during that time. Hawaii offered a different scenario to the US since proximity wise it is closer than the mainland and its location in the center of the Pacific serves as a perfect gateway to the US.&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Forum:&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">Can you think of other relationship that exists between history and geography in the Philippine context?

as an authentic source of drug-related information and vital part of the healthcare community.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">In my years of studying and early years of practice, I desired for more patient-oriented pharmacy practice.

Indeed, it was a rewarding experience to be able to provide drug therapy counseling to patients. Fast forward to today, seeing how our TUA students raise the practice of pharmacy makes my career road a more meaningful, fulfilling and rewarding one.

Students are also taught how to perform associated clerical duties, including scheduling and maintaining paperwork for office and clinical settings.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are required to attend an On the Job Training (OJT) in different tertiary hospitals doing clinical duty. Students are given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in an actual work setting. To become a licensed radiologic technologist, a graduate of BS in Radiologic Technology needs to pass the Radiologic Technology Licensure Examination. The examination is conducted by the Board of Radiologic Technology under the supervision of the Professional Regulations Commission (PRC). Radiologic Technologists perform imaging and therapeutic examinations to patients. They are responsible for positioning patients on the lab equipment to ensure that a quality diagnostic image is produced. They work closely with radiologists in diagnosing these images for any possible disease, injury, and treatment</span></h4><h4 style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""@@PLUGINFILE@@/INTERVENTIONAL.png?time=1597452130351"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""153"" role=""presentation"" class=""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom"">&nbsp;<img src=""@@PLUGINFILE@@/UTZ.png?time=1597452662964"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""151"" role=""presentation"" class=""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom""><img src=""@@PLUGINFILE@@/MAMMO.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""162"" role=""presentation"" class=""img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom""></strong></h4><p style=""text-align: center; ""><span style=""text-align: left;""></span></p><h3 style=""font-size: 0.9375rem; text-align: center;""><strong><h3><strong><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(255, 51, 102);"">CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</span></strong></h3></strong></h3><h3 style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><br></h3><h3><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(0, 61, 245);""><h3><span><strong><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(0, 61, 245);"">G</span><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(0, 61, 245);"">r</span></strong></span><span><span><strong><span class="""" style=""color: rgb(0, 61, 245);"">aduates of BS in Radiologic Technology may pursue a career path in different tertiary hospitals with a wide range of opportunities.
